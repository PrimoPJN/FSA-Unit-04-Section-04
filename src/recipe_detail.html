          <h1>MAGIC CAKE</h1>
          <p>
            One simple batter turns into a 3 layered cake with a top layer of
            sponge, a middle layer of custard and a fudge-like base. It's
            like....magic! Adapted from Magic Cake by Jo Cooks.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>4 eggs , yolks and whites separated (at room temperature)</li>
              <li>3/4 cup (150g) sugar (ordinary or caster sugar)</li>
              <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
              <li>1 stick (4oz / 125g / 1/2 cup) unsalted butter , melted</li>
              <li>3/4 cup (4oz / 115g) plain all purpose flour</li>
              <li>
                2 cups (500 ml / 1 pint) milk (lukewarm) (full fat or low fat
                but not zero fat)
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Preheat oven to 325F/160C (standard oven / fan forced or convection).</li>
              <li>Butter a 8" x 8" / 20cm x 20cm square cake tin (Note 4).</li>
              <li>Beat egg whites with a mixer until stiff peaks form. Set aside.</li>
              <li>Place the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and beat until it turns pale yellow - about 1 minute.</li>
              <li>Add the vanilla extract and butter and beat until well incorporated - about 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
              <li>Add the flour and beat until just combined.</li>
              <li>Pour the milk in slowly while beating, and beat until well combined (or if using a hand held mixer, add 1/4 milk at a time, beating in between).</li>
              <li>Use a spatula to fold in the egg whites in the batter, one third at a time, until just incorporated. You don't want to knock the air out of the egg whites. Don't worry if there are a few egg white lumps in the batter. The batter should be very thin, almost like a thick pouring cream.</li>
              <li>Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Baking Directions</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Bake until the top is golden brown and the cake does not "jiggle" when you gently shake the tin - around 40 to 50 minutes. Check the cake at 30 minutes - if the top is already golden brown but the cake is not yet set (i.e. it jiggles), cover loosely with foil and return to the oven, 10 minutes at a time, until set.</li>
              <li>Allow to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a cooling rack.(Note 3) Cool completely before serving.</li>
            </ol>
              
            <h3>To Serve</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Cut into squares - I cut it into 12 in the photo, but 9 is more realistic serving size portions.</li>
              <li>Dust with icing sugar just before serving.</li>
              <li>Serve with a side of whipped cream and strawberries, if using.</li>
            </ol>
